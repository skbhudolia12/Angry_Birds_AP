Github repository owners - Sarthak Bhudolia (2023491) & Sakshat Sachdeva (2023474)

This is our README File in accordance to Deadline 2 of our AP Project.
- We have created our project on LibGDX.
- To run the program, you must run the program using gradle in IntelliJ
- On running, a loading screen will open up which will then take you to the Main Menu Screen of our game
- Here, you can either choose to enter the game, mute/unmute the game or exit the game.
- Upon exit, the code will be terminated and you will be out.
- If you choose to enter the game, you will see the level selection menu.
- Here we, have created level 1 with all the elements in it, however, level 2 is just a framework/background for the level.
- You can navigate from the Level Selection screen to Main Menu with the back button located bottom left.
- On entering Level 1, you can either choose to Pause the game using 'P' command on your keyboard.
- In the Pause menu, you can navigate to restart the level, resume the level or quit back to the level selection screen.
- While in Level 1, pressing the 'N' command on your keyboard, you will open the Level Completion Screen.
- Here, you can either go to the next level i.e lvl 2, replay the level or quit back to main menu.

This is a complete go through for our project submission.

Thank you.
